		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Gamocosm is FOSS.
			Gamocosm doesn't accept payment, no ads, and no tracking user data.
			I pay for all the development and production costs out of my pocket.
			I do this because I want to make something useful.
			I'll accept donations later if costs start being an issue.
			I intend to keep everything as transparent as possible.
